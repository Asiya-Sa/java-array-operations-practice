# Java Array Practice 📊

A Java program that demonstrates various operations on 1D and 2D arrays. This was a lab assignment for practicing array manipulation.

## ✨ Operations Performed

### 1D Array Operations (arr1 = {2, 2, 4, 5, 1, 7})
- Find maximum and minimum values
- Calculate sum and average
- Display even and odd numbers
- Calculate squares of all elements
- Add two 1D arrays (arr1 + arr3)

### 2D Array Operations (arr2 = 3×4 matrix)
- Find maximum and minimum values
- Calculate sum and average
- Display even and odd numbers
- Calculate squares of all elements
- Multiply two 2D arrays (arr2 × arr5)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java** - Core programming language
- **NetBeans IDE** - Development environment

## 🚀 How to Run

### Using Command Line:
javac DataSLab1.java

### Using NetBeans:
1. Open the file in NetBeans
2. Click Run button (or press F6)
